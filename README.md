# Not quite AXI (nqaxi)

Not quite AXI is the place for AXI-related IPs that:
* are barley tested or not tested at all
* are not fully AXI-conform
* are created as a bodge but someone think it there may be potential reuse
* are just too simple or too specific to be merged in to AXI Mainline

Use at your own risk! But please feel free to contribute.
