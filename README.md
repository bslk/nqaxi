# Not quite AXI (nqaxi)

Not quite AXI is the place for AXI-related IPs that:
* are barley tested or not tested at all
* are not fully AXI-conform
* were created as a bodge but someone thinks there may be potential reuse
* are just too simple or too specific to be merged into Mainline AXI

Use at your own risk! But please feel free to contribute.
